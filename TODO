Something I think is happening:
 - paiement groups get -1s for client ids when system starts pushing 
    groups before it has all server ids for clients
 - on 10/17, we lost a bunch of payment groups. why?

* extract mailing lists (format?)

* use database for user login authentication, not stuff in textfiles! (.5 day)
