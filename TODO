--- version beta1:

* effacer inscription (table of deletes)

to server:
* store payment group (what if you're merging groups?!)
* store payments
   * calculate outstanding balance for users (use frais_famille if there)

* export to CSV

* more testing of roundtripping of all information to remote server
   + (it seems to work)

* tweak list of stored html files locally with gears

--- later:

* autosuggest for payment groups

* implement merges/conflicts
* view/edit grade history 
   + (I think the current UI for both grades & services is OK,
      but we need to add 'view history' pop-up link.)

* push deletes to server: put another table for deletes with id & version,
                          send delete requests to the server?

* implement table for tournament results

* use database for user login authentication, not stuff in textfiles!
* implement system config tables:
   - saison
   - groupes
   - frais
   - dates for cheques
