--- version beta1:

* export to CSV, especially classes

* more testing of roundtripping of all information to remote server
   + (it seems to work)

--- later:

* autosuggest for payment groups

* implement merges/conflicts
* view/edit grade history 
   + (I think the current UI for both grades & services is OK,
      but we need to add 'view history' pop-up link.)

* implement table for tournament results

* use database for user login authentication, not stuff in textfiles!
* implement system config tables:
   - saison
   - groupes
   - frais
   - suggested dates for cheques
