Here is the declarative specification for the sync algorithm.

* when updating (c = client, s = server)
  /* invariant: c.version >= c.server_version */
  if c.server_version = s.version, we can freely update:
    if c.version = c.server_version, no changes
    if c.version > c.server_version, push to server

  if c.server_version < s.version, 
    if c.version = c.server_version, pull from server
    if c.version > c.server_version, merge changes

  if local server_version > remote ver: should not happen.

Here is the imperative algorithm.

var client.server_version; // -1 means "new"
var client.version, server.version;
pull from server:
   - send the complete list of ids and server.versions to client
   - client asks for any ids it does not have
   - if client has an id but client.server_version < server.version:
       + if client.version = client.server_version, pull.
       + if client.version > client.server_version, merge conflicts
           (keep a table of merge conflicts and a nav screen for it)
push to server: (assume this is after pulling).
   - send all entries with client.v > .sv.
   - send back new server_id from server to client
       + can then set client.server_version to client.version.

Merge conflicts algorithm is as follows.

When we have two conflicting sets of fields, we compare each field.
Fields which are not equal (e.g. values x, y) become x || y.
Merging x with w||x||y should give w||x||y.
